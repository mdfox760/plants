<strong>Greenhouses</strong>
<p>
  Greenhouses are needed for climate challenged regions. Too cold is no good.
  Too hot is no good. Too wet is no good. You get the picture. They also come
  in different shapes, sizes and material types. They are ultimately customizable.
  To build a greenhouse on the cheap you would use a clear plastic wrapped around
  a aluminum tube frame. The shape is like a tunnel. The size is up to you. How tall
  do you want it? How long? How wide? The build time is minimal, in a couple of
  hours you have a workable greenhouse.

  You could also go the traditional way. A concrete pad with a wooden or metal frame.
  Some people throw in plumbing, electrical systems and even fridges for the crop.
  Grow lights, working tables and racks for trays of plants are also very common.
  Light is essential so windows are everywhere. Temperature control is the goal
  so the windows must open up high to let out the heat when it becomes too much
  for the plants. The world is your oyster when you have a greenhouse.

<strong>Grow Rooms</strong>
<p>
  Grow rooms don't have to be entire rooms. They can be a tent like structure.
  Think of them as greenhouses for small spaces like apartments. They come in
  different sizes so the choice simply needs to fit the space available. Indoors,
   grow rooms will need a light souce that duplicates sunlight. These are grow lights.
  The tent like structures can have a scaffolding element to them for lights to
  be mounted upon. The arrigation will simply have
  tubes traveling down to the pots or hydroponic tanks through small holes. As far
  as the lights go, they will be on a pully system attached to the scaffolding so
  they may be raised as the plants grow to keep the light source in the optimum
  position. The tents are often foil lined. They are available with small doors
  and large doors depending on your choice of grow tent.
